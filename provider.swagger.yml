  title: French consultations portal platform providers endpoints definition
  description: >
    This document defines the minimal API endpoints exposed by consultation solutions providers for the French consultations portal platform, for allowing on-demand deployments. This document has been produced as a collaborative work by [Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/), [Cap Collectif](https://cap-collectif.com/) and [Bluenove](http://bluenove.com/).
      
    This document specifies the minimal common API set. Each and every data structure specified here may be extended with additionnal metadata. Also, some API navigation mechanisms have not been specified in this document. It is up to each provider to decide whether or not to provide these facilities.
      
    Providers API endpoints `MUST` be exposed through https or http2.

        400:
          description: >
            The request cannot be executed, for reasons due to the request that will normally preclude a retry.
            Examples: slug too long.
            Special case: If the slug already exists, the answer should be a 400 UNLESS the instance is in a failed state (AND it can be retried.)
            In that case, retry creating the instance with the same Location as previously, and return a 201, 202 or 500 appropriately.

      - message
    properties:
      code:
        type: integer
        description: >
          An error code which describes the error in a non ambiguous way. There are two cases:
            * a standardized error code has been defined for the error which occured. Standardized error codes always start with digits `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7` or `8`. In this case, this error code may be used.
            * no specific error code has been defined for the error which occured. In this case, the *provider* may include a custom error code. Custom error codes always start with the `9` digit. More specifically, it is forbidden and invalid to use a custom error code starting with another digit than `9`. The *platform* should not expect custom error codes to be robust, durable, standard or identical accross providers. They shall only be used for informational purpose.
            
          Here is the list of standardized error codes:
            * `100`: payload data is invalid
            * `101`: the slug already exists
      message:
        type: string
